# ESG-Topic-Model

## Introduction
As sustainable development gains momentum, non-financial information has become a critical metric for evaluating enterprises. This shift has led more companies to voluntarily disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Most current research on ESG (CSR) reports is conducted by major ESG rating agencies, while academic studies tend to rely on quantitative analyses based on these ratings. However, this approach often overlooks the valuable insights contained within the textual content of ESG (CSR) reports.

In the near future, we aim to develop an efficient deep learning model for ESG ratings and conduct some compelling empirical research. We look forward to you shining stars for us and
woking together to support high-quality and meaningful research!
