# CSR-Topic-Model
As sustainable development becomes deeply ingrained, non-financial information has increasingly become a crucial metric for evaluating enterprises, leading more companies to voluntarily disclose corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Current research on CSR reports is mainly conducted by major ESG rating agencies, with academic studies often focusing on quantitative analyses based on these ratings. However, this approach often overlooks the rich textual content within the CSR reports themselves. We aim to employ large-scale pre-trained language models to perform topic modeling on CSR reports disclosed by Chinese listed companies and explore downstream applications, including but not limited to causal inference and time-series forecasting.
